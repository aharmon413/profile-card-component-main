### What I learned

A quick and easy challenge from Frontend Mentor. I built this using a mobile first workflow and it was good practice for building a simple card element which is used in a variety of contexts. The biggest pain here was positioning the SVGs in the background and is something I need to experiment with to feel more comfortable with.
